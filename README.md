# EmployeePayroll
This task was part of my Hyperion bootcamp. The main focus was to learn how classes and extending classes works. 

The program takes the input of some employee data, like name, age, sales and targets and gives an output to let the user know whether or not each of the employees has met their targets.

# How to run

This is just a simple Javascript file. If you have Node installed in your IDE then you will be able to run it there and view the outputs in the console
